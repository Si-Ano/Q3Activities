						<h4> Wanda Maximoff </h4>
						<p> Soon after the Battle of Earth, Wanda Maximoff became overwhelmed by immense grief from her recent personal losses, unwittingly unleashing her Chaos Magic powers to enthrall the citizens of Westview into creating an alternate idyllic paradise of classical sitcom tropes. With a recreated Vision as her husband, Maximoff lived her ideal life, even producing twin sons, Tommy and Billy. Further complicating the crisis was Agatha Harkness, a fellow witch who sought to understand the nature of Maximoff's new reality, and a S.W.O.R.D. operation led by Tyler Hayward who wished to eliminate her. Maximoff, now knowing her own identity as the fabled Scarlet Witch, defeated Harkness and the S.W.O.R.D. agents, and dispelled her reality, erasing her family in the process. As she was now wanted, Maximoff fled into isolation and began studying the Darkhold. </p>

						<h4> Vision </h4>
						<p> Vision was a recreation of the synthezoid of the same name, created by Wanda Maximoff using Chaos Magic during her meltdown in Westview over the loss of the original Vision, who was her lover, which reset the town to a sitcom-style ambience. For a couple of days, Vision lived peacefully with Maximoff and conceived twin sons with her, but soon discovered that Westview was not what it seemed. Vision became aware of the brainwashed citizens, the Hex, Maximoff's past and actions, as well as the life of the original Vision with the help of Darcy Lewis. He aided his family by fighting White Vision in the Battle of Westview before restoring his memories, and in the immediate aftermath, Vision and Maximoff bade farewell to each other as the latter dispelled the Hex, erasing Vision and his children. </p>

						<h4> Tommy Maximoff </h4>
						<p> Thomas "Tommy" Maximoff was the son of Wanda Maximoff and Vision, and the twin brother of Billy Maximoff. Created and raised within the Westview Anomaly, he, along with his brother, were targeted by S.W.O.R.D. and eventually captured by Agatha Harkness. During the Battle of Westview, the brothers were freed and helped defeat the S.W.O.R.D. agents. Following the battle, Wanda dispelled the Hex, which resulted in Tommy and his brother being erased from existence.</p>
